# The Developer Log

### 11.10.2018 - Login get beautiful
Hey guys

as already communicated in the roadmap, I dont like the latest basic html code login interface, so I was on the search and looked for an open source free available login form, and I found it.

For now its in the repo only, so you have to clone it to test it, but its just for the eyes, nothing regarding the functionality.
Ps. Did I told you about the new logo I created :) (ok, an free icon and a text, well how you want tocall it)?

### 11.10.2018 - Start of the Developer Log
Hello,

Yes, thats my first try to start a developer log book.
It should not be like a blog, but more information stuff of what changes are made or what just got changed etc.
