# ownhealthrecord
This repository is about the Own Health Record Application Web App

## Whats about?
One problem I faced personally is, that I have different doctors and through traveling and moving to another cities, every doctor has only a snippet of my medical data records.
This can cause problems, due if Im sick and dont know the medical name for it, the doctor doesnt know about my health problems and so on.
For that reason, and because the German Insurances and Doctor Software Supplier are unable to get something working, I decide to make my own health record to have the medical history on my side.

## When it will be shared?
Soon, at least I hope.
The Problem is, Im using a HTML/CSS Dashboard Template from a third party developer and he doesnt has shared the license for it and due I really like the design of it, I want to use it. I made already a running proof of work web app withthe basic functionality, but its not yet ready for productive use and represent more a early alpha (really, I suppose you dont want just to use a one page table).
